Misc Weaved Bins

These bins are build for random platforms as noted.  They are staticly linked binaries to be compatable with the widest range of systems.  They should not be considered up to date or optimized in any way for any particular platform.  One of these should however run on your embedded linux platoform.

If none of these run, let me know and we will will help you build it for your platform.
