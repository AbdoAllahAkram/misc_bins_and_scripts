Misc Weaved Embedded Bins

These bins are build for some platforms not included in the standard installer.  They are staticly linked binaries to be compatable with the widest range of systems.  They should not be considered up to date or optimized in any way for any particular platform.  One of these should however run on your embedded linux platoform.  There may be duplicates or multiple compatible binaires here.

If none of these run, let me know and we will will help you build it for your platform.

Currently here are:
- weavedConnectd.arm.uclib.static : ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1, statically linked
- weavedConnectd.arm-eabi.static : ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked
- weavedConnectd.arm-linaro.static : ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked (pi static)
- weavedConnectd.mips-openwrt : ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 rel2 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked
- weavedConnectd.mips-old.static : ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked
